## How It Works

The Optimus Gold Forex Software utilizes a trend-following strategy to generate buy and sell signals. The software analyzes the market trend and executes trades accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities of the code:

### Libraries and Constants

The necessary libraries, including Trade and Trend, are included at the beginning of the code. Additionally, constants such as RISK_PERCENT and STOP_LOSS are defined.

### Global Variables

The code initializes global variables, including the Trade and Trend objects, which are used throughout the program.

### OnTick Function

The custom OnTick function is executed on each tick of the market. It checks the market trend and generates buy or sell signals accordingly. The entry price, stop-loss price, and lot size are calculated based on predefined risk management parameters. The Trade object is then used to place the corresponding buy or sell order.

### OnInit Function

The custom OnInit function is executed during the initialization of the program. It initializes the Trade and Trend objects, sets the expert magic number, and sets up a user-friendly interface by adding a chart event listener for click events.

### OnChartClick Function

The custom OnChartClick function is triggered when a chart click event occurs. In this code, it is used to display real-time market data updates when the user clicks on the chart. The current market price is retrieved using the SymbolInfoDouble function, and the price is displayed on the chart using the Comment function.

### OnDeinit Function

The custom OnDeinit function is executed when the program is deinitialized. It is responsible for cleaning up resources by deinitializing the Trade and Trend objects.

### OnStart Function

The custom OnStart function is executed when the program starts running. It enables real-time alerts and notifications and sets up backtesting capabilities if the program is running in testing mode.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and does not include the complete functionality of the Optimus Gold Forex Software. To get the full functionality and official version of this software, please refer to the official developer on MQL5.
